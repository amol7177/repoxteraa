                    <p class="card-text">In a software world, the terms back-end and front-end refer to the distinction between the data access layer (back-end) and the presentation layer (front-end) of a software.

                      This software details a client-server model. According to the thumb rule, the server-side of the model is any component that handles data storage and business logic, and the client-side is an abstraction that a user manipulates.
                      
                      While the front-end is the visible portion of the iceberg, the back-end is the huge, invisible portion of the same iceberg. And in this context, you will learn about the invisible portion of the iceberg- the back-end. </p>
<p>
It is the backend of the website or application that allows it to function well, and be fast and responsive. But, due to the exponential growth of back-end technologies over the past few years, it can be difficult for developers to keep up with the sheer amount of technology at their disposal.  It is essential, however, regardless of whether you are an IT manager, startup founder, or a corporate decision-maker, that you pick the right backend technology before moving forward with your project.
